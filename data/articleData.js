            paragraph:
              'Some galaxies have satellites that can be very small and barely visible against the backdrop of the main galaxy. For example, the Magellanic Clouds are satellites of our Milky Way and contain vast numbers of young stars. These satellites often result from gravitational interactions with the main galaxy and can influence its evolution.',
